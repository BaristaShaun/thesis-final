# üéì Interactive Supplementary Dashboard  
#### *Prospective LCA of Sustainable Aviation Fuels*  
##### *Scenario-Based Assessment Using Integrated Assessment Models (2020‚Äì2050)*

This dashboard serves as a supplementary component to the Master's thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree **Master of Science (M.Sc.)**  
at the **TUM School of Life Sciences**, Technical University of Munich.

The thesis explores the prospective environmental performance of various Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production pathways.  
It applies a harmonized Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach based on the ISO 14040/44 framework,  
integrating forward-looking scenarios from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) over the period 2020 to 2050.

All interactive modules in this dashboard aim to ensure transparent, reproducible, and accessible dissemination of LCA findings.

## üìÇ Structure and Content

**(1) Overview**  
Provides a comparative summary of environmental impacts across SAF pathways, including GHG and non-GHG indicators.

**(2) Monetization**  
Displays the external costs associated with each pathway by converting midpoint environmental impacts into economic terms (‚Ç¨/kg fuel), based on EF 3.1 monetization factors.

**(3) Process Contribution**  
Breaks down the relative contribution of individual unit processes (e.g., feedstock supply, synthesis) to the overall impact profile of each fuel.

**(4) Process Heatmap**  
Visualizes process-specific environmental burdens across multiple impact categories to identify environmental hotspots.

**(5) Prospective**  
Presents forward-looking emission trends under three IAM-based scenarios (Optimistic, Middle, Pessimistic) from 2020 to 2050.

**(6) Raw Data**  
Provides access to selected life cycle inventory (LCI) results and characterization scores used in the thesis, for transparency and potential reuse.
